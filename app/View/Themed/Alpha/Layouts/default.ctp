					APR is a commonly used abbreviation that stands for Annual Percentage Rate. This is a formula computed to show you what the interest rate combined with all the fees of a loan will be, in total, when analyzed for an entire year. APR is a way for you to compare and shop by knowing what the representative APR ranges might be for a loan that you may receive on our site.<br/><br/>
When using our service to find a lender, the lender is required to provide you, the consumer, with all costs associated to be expressed as an annual percentage rate of interest (APR). This information will include the identity of the lender, the amount financed, the itemization of amount financed, the finance charge, the annual percentage rate, your payment schedule and your total number of payments. You will be able to review all this information BEFORE you obligate yourself to any loan. Your interest rate will vary depending upon which product you select from which lender. In addition, the Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits lenders from discriminating against applicants on the basis of color, race, religion, sex, marital status and age.

				We are not your lender. Our service provides an easy and convenient way for consumers to be connected with a personal loan through our network of lenders. <br/></br/>
Because there are many lenders offering many different products we donâ€™t know the exact APR that a lender may offer you.  But rest assured, your lender must disclose all this information to you before you obligate yourself to any loan.  The APR on a personal loan from our network of lenders can range from 5.99% to 35.99%, with loan durations between 90 days and 72 months. The actual loan rate depends on the loan amount and term requested, as well as your credit score, usage, and history. If you are offered a loan, you will have the opportunity to review the final offer made by the lender, and to accept the loan agreement made directly between you and the lender.

		                        Once you are connected with a lender, you will be given all of your loan terms, in advance and in writing, for you to review. If you accept the terms and conditions of the loan offer, you are agreeing to pay that loan back in the amount of time expressed in the loan documents. If you do not understand anything in the loan agreement, you should not move forward. You should always pay your loan back on time to avoid additional fees and penalties. Partial payment, non-payment, or late payment is likely to result in the following:
		                        <ul>
		                        <li>Associated Fees/Interest rate adjustment - some lenders will charge fees, or adjust your interest rate if you are making late payments.</li>
		                        <li>Collection practices - If you refuse to repay the loan all together, it is likely that the lender will engage a collection company 
		                            to try and recoup what you owe them (just like any lender would).</li>
		                        <li>Credit Score impact - if you do not repay your loan on time, your delinquency may be reported to a credit bureau, 
		                            which could negatively impact your credit score.</li>
		                        <li>Renewal policy - As a convenience to you, some lenders may offer a renewed or "roll-over" loan that may have additional fees and may 
		                            renew automatically, unless you request otherwise. Please make sure to review your lender's renewal policies, and make sure that your 
		                            payment preferences are known to your lender.</li>
		                        </ul>
		                        This information will be disclosed by each individual lender. Please don't agree to any loan that you cannot repay. If you have questions or need more information on late payment or renewal policies, please contact the lender directly and they will be happy to provide you that information. While most lenders in this site's network do not run a traditional credit check, it is important for us to let you know that in some cases credit checks, consumer credit reports and other personal data may be obtained by some lenders. These checks typically are performed by Experian, Equifax, Trans Union or through alternative providers in order to make a decision on whether or not to offer you a loan. As with any loan, it's important to repay the loan on time or contact the lender to work out a payment plan just as soon as possible.
